## spec

I did this a while ago for the Free Code Camp product landing page project. This was my first ever project and i'm happy with how it came out.

##  Improvements

- I did improve this a lot from my initial attempt, i used a grid layout then for the products because i didn't really understand flex back then. Good news is I understand it a lot better now and I think the flex box product cards look really good.
- I also heavily relied on IDs back then so i changed it to be more class based.
- The navbar came out really well, i like the layout with the nav buttons on one side and the logo on the other.

## To be improved

- The html isn't very well laid out or readable. I would go back and change it to a more logical order.
- The navbar could be improved with js, i would change it so that on mobile sevices it changes to three bars in the top righthand corner. I am going to learn that next.
- I could link a contact form to it and put the products on a different pages but i am still learning how to do that.
